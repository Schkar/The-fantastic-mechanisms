# The-unbelievable-mechanisms
Final project for Coder's lab course.<br>
Simple "The incredible machines"-like game made entirely in HTML (Canvas) with JS and CSS (SASS) <br>

Whole application is written by me, including physics engine (no external libraries used!)

Project in moderate stage of development (v.0.9.5).

<br>There is only one playable "level" with basic functionalities. More to come:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>rotated objects</li><strong>DONE</strong>
    <li>collisions with rotated objects</li><strong>DONE</strong>
    <li>better gravity</li><strong>DONE</strong>
    <li>mass and force</li><strong>DONE</strong>
    <li>more object types</li>
</ul>
